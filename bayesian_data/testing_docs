Our administrators, like our teachers, work to individualize experiences for stakeholders by welcoming parents to drop in to school whenever they like discuss the best way to serve families. As a small school, between our three administrators we know every student on campus and are very hands on with all student support issues that arise. We offer an advisory section for each 9th through 12 th grade student. Every Tuesday and Thursday, from 1:10 to 1:40 PM students meet in groups of 18 to 20 with a grade-level teacher advisor. The objective of this advisory section is to help ensure that each student at the Academy has a meaningful connection with an adult at school, while increasing community, academic success and attendance rates. Students engage in goal setting, attendance and students planner checks and receive important information. There are monthly grade-level meetings and once a grading period there are all-school meetings. Student Support Programs The Academy of Arts and Sciences features a Wellness Center , two full-time academic counselors and a full-time college counselor.

Garfield Is A Public Elementary School Located At The Base Of Coit Tower, In One Of The Most Picturesque Spots In The City Of San Francisco. As one of the first public elementary schools in the city, Garfield has been providing a rich academic environment for local children for more than 100 years. Today, Garfield is a small, tight-knit community serving 240 children of diverse cultural and economic backgrounds in grades K-5.
Garfield’s campus is just a short walk to San Francisco’s famed Chinatown, the largest Chinatown outside of Asia, and probably the most culturally-rich. All dual-immersion classroom instruction is enhanced through cultural enrichment activities including field trips in and around Chinatown, cultural celebrations and awareness days, visual and performance arts, media, and use of various computer technologies.

What Do You Like Most About Garfield? The staff is very kind, hard-working and professional. Our students’ smiles. The magical location. What Are 5 Things You Can’t Live Without? Smiles, beauty, love, music and the idea that we all have a responsibility to leave our world a little better than we found it; the notion that we must ensure that each generation must become better, smarter, funnier, and wiser than the preceding one.

Hoover is committed to listening and responding to our students, families, and staff within a culture of service and support. At Hoover, we believe we are here to provide the tools to build academic and social skills, increase self-esteem, and foster positive adolescent development. We continue to explore new ways to develop our culture so that every family and student in our school feels included.
Herbert Hoover Middle School does not release kids from school without written consent (note, email or faxed 759-2881 note). Phone calls are not accepted to excuse absences. Written notes are required to excuse any absences, when the student returns to school. Otherwise, they will be marked as an unexcused absence. 
Vision Statement The mission at Hoover reflects the diverse needs of a comprehensive city middle school as well as the expectations placed upon the schools by society and the governing bodies. First and foremost, Hoover’s academic goals ensure that each youngster learns not just the basic skills and fundamental processes of education, but that each youngster develop the ability to think rationally, problem solve and evaluate knowledge which will enable him to make judgments and decisions as a student and citizen. In our complex, interdependent world we must help youngsters to understand, appreciate and value persons belonging to social, cultural and ethnic groups different from their own. We must convey to the youngsters a knowledge of the basic workings of government and to develop a commitment to society by exhibiting kindness, compassion and a willingness to share with others less fortunate.
