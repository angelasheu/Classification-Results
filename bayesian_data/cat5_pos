There are two classes of the AVID elective, one at 7th grade and one at 8th grade. In the 7th grade elective class, AVID students are introduced to the 4 components of the AVID curriculum: Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, and Reading. A major emphasis in the 7th grade is for students to develop inquiry and collaboration skills as students work with college students during tutorials sessions. In the 8th grade elective class, AVID students continue to develop their WICR strategies needed for high school and college, but further look at the importance of choosing the right high school and the requirements needed to apply to a college / university. Both elective classes support students in their core classes of Math, English/Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science through tutorials and various in class assignments. The AVID elective class is not a remedial or intervention class. The curriculum is rigorous and pushes students to become their own advocates in an academic setting to hone their skills in their other classes. Highlights: * Field Trips - Stanford and San Francisco State University; Washington HS and Lincoln HS; Day at Law School (UC Hastings) * Guest Speakers on Fridays * College mentors and tutors leading tutorials twice a week MISSION AVID's mission is to close the achievement gap by preparing all students for college readiness and success in a global society.
