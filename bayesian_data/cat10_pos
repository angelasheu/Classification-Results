We offer an advisory section for each 9th through 12th grade student. Every Tuesday and Thursday, from 1:10 to 1:40 PM students meet in groups of 18 to 20 with a grade-level teacher advisor. The objective of this advisory section is to help ensure that each student at the Academy has a meaningful connection with an adult at school, while increasing community, academic success and attendance rates. Students engage in goal setting, attendance and students planner checks and receive important information. There are monthly grade-level meetings and once a grading period there are all-school meetings.
