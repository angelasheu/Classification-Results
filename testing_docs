Our administrators, like our teachers, work to individualize experiences for stakeholders by welcoming parents to drop in to school whenever they like discuss the best way to serve families. As a small school, between our three administrators we know every student on campus and are very hands on with all student support issues that arise. We offer an advisory section for each 9th through 12 th grade student. Every Tuesday and Thursday, from 1:10 to 1:40 PM students meet in groups of 18 to 20 with a grade-level teacher advisor. The objective of this advisory section is to help ensure that each student at the Academy has a meaningful connection with an adult at school, while increasing community, academic success and attendance rates. Students engage in goal setting, attendance and students planner checks and receive important information. There are monthly grade-level meetings and once a grading period there are all-school meetings. Student Support Programs The Academy of Arts and Sciences features a Wellness Center , two full-time academic counselors and a full-time college counselor.

We stand firm in our commitment to support students' development of leadership skills so that they can make a positive impact on their local and global communities. Students can become involved and develop leadership skills through programs such as Student Council, Youth Outreach Workers, Safe School Ambassadors, and Peer Resources.. A diverse group of students have a voice in the school and provide community service by participating as Youth Outreach Workers, Safe School Ambassadors, Student Council members, SSC representatives, National Junior Honor Society participants, and conflict mediators. We believe that parents are critical partners in the education of our children. The school has a parent room which serves as a place where parents can come to meet other parents and participate in monthly Principal Chats. We have very active parent groups, and welcome many parent involvement and we're always looking for ways to increase parent participation from all our families. Our parent liaison is dedicated to providing parents with important information regarding school matters that impact our students and to serving as a link between school staff and parents.
